Hi friend, I am **{
	data.bio.name
}**, {
	labels && labelsDisplay(labels)

} {
	origin && `(originally from ${addressDisplay(origin)})`
}.

Welcome to my small, personal corner of the Internet. Click around and make
yourself at home. To make the most of this visit, I would recommend checking out
[some stuff I've written](/writings) and my [interactive résumé](/resume).

If there's anything more you'd like to know, just ask!

## Contact

If you have a new and interesting idea that I could collaborate on, or want to
ask a question that I might be able to answer, or simply want to talk, you
should drop by and say hi!
